# Geometry2D
A library to construct some basic classes and conduct some basic functions of 2d geometry.
Classes includes point, segment, polygon and vector. Functions includes to generate distance from point to point, from point to line, from line to line, to determine whether two lines are horizontal or vertical, and to determine whether a point is in a polygon.
Besides, it defines several exceptions to safely conduct these functions with precious exception messages.
